In this experiment, we choose 5 images semantic segmentation network could not ignore black marks and and black marks were included in predictions. 
Then we apply Black mark detection using YOLO on them, 
later we apply our inpainting method, 
and we get semantic segmentation network's prediction on these new "black marks removed" images.

Below we plot the images before and after this method:
