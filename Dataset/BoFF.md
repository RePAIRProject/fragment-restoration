# Black-marks on the Fractured Fresco Fragments (BOFF) dataset

The **Black-marks on the Fresco Fragments** (**BOFF**) dataset is created to facilitate the detection and removal of black marks through inpainting, and it contains fragments images along with bounding box annotation of black marks. 

The annotation of bounding boxes was created using [https://app.roboflow.com/](roboflow.com) which provides a powerfull set of tools for managing image datasets for computer vision applications.


The dataset contains 115 fragment images, which do not necessarily contain motifs on their intact surfaces, which contain 405 black mark annotations. Black marks locate either on the monochromatic regions or on the textured regions, which form a more challenging task compared to the former.
Moreover, black marks mostly locate close to fragment boundaries, while in few images there are also black marks in the center of the fragment surface.
